mindblowing!!!!
life with fire
one of the biggest nail-biters of the season.
lower key
rabid dog is a rabid episode.
breaking bad is the best
wow!!!
to hajilee!
can it get any better than this?
"to'hajiilee" is the "dead freight" of the second half of season 5
beyond awesome.....can't imagine what's in store for last 3 episodes
breaking bad outdoing themselves for the thousandth time!
out heisenberg heisenberg
one of the best episodes
the bb episode
greatest show on earth
shocking intense awesome i'm still shaking
a reunion in the desert
one of the most crucial episodes
is walter white getting arrested?
personally, my favourite bb episode so far...
best broadcast show in history
dang!
absolute chaos
too many things to handle!
the desert scene is first-rate and eclipses some of the weaker parts of "to'hajiilee"
the fun begins!
i'm still sitting here...
you will not breath for an hour
why 9.9? it deserves 10
the greatest episode of the greatest tv show of all time
not what you might expect...
the episode that has solidified breaking bad's status as the greatest show of all time
ozymandias- even the most powerful fall...
i feel sick
the best episode in history of television
unbelievable
shock after shock to the fullest excess
ozymandias ... the best hour of tv. ever.
walter white is the king
i guarantee you will cry
breaking bad vs attack on titan
best episode ever 10 out of 10
my name is ozymandias, king of tv series episodes and films alike.
the most amazing hour of television ever produced.
high expectations
nothing beside remains
my spoiler-free review of this week's episode of breaking bad
get the 10/10 back!
my dear walt, your world is coming to an end. and that makes me sad.
how is it going to end
the reason was there from the beginning..
"it's over"
holy....
true brilliance...
supremely depressing and great just because of that
they never run out of ideas...
rock bottom
granite state
expertly written penultimate episode.
what happens next ?!
the best ending of an episode in tv history
you can feel the intensity in the air....
all hell is ready to break loose
breaking bad sets a world record
at the end of the episode...
yep were ready!
live free or die
"the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew, long ago, he's now gone"
great episode before the finale!
a perfect prologue for the epic epilogue..
it's perfect
the calm before the storm...
"what it is i know, but with gratitude my tears fall."
i've just finished got
so hard to say goodbye
here after got
the greatest tv show of all time
perfect end for a perfect series
"riding alone in the dark. maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me."
season 5 of breaking bad will be remembered as the single greatest achievement in television history
goat
this will be seriously missed
heisenberg, the legend
